## Abstract
This project will provide a playable environment using a VR set, specifically the Quest 2, in which the user will be able to interact with a virtual world as a character and enjoy the different challenges the environment will provide to them. The challenges will consist of a set of obstacles different to each other and specific to the different environments. The user will have to pass through all obstacles by jumping, running or moving in order to get to the end of each of the virtual worlds and win each level environment before the time ends.
