# VR obstacle course game
## Abstract
This project will provide a playable environment using a VR set, specifically the Quest 2, in which the user will be able to interact with a virtual world as a character and enjoy the different challenges the environment will provide to them. The challenges will consist of a set of obstacles different to each other and specific to the different environments. The user will have to pass through all obstacles by jumping, running or moving in order to get to the end of each of the virtual worlds and win each level environment before the time ends.

## Introduction
Our objective is to use Unity to create three different scenes in which a character controlled by the user will have to get to the end of the map avoiding different obstacles along the way by jumping and running away from the objects created to stop the character. 
The game will provide an enjoyable environment for the user to get distracted from the stress of the real world and find interactive challenges that will be fun to overcome while using the Quest 2 headset.
