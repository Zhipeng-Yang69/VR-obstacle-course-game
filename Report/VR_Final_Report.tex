\maketitle

This game idea is the result of a common interest in our group of understanding 
the enjoyment from interaction of the user in a game using VR and the different 
methods used to achieve this goal. All members of the group have tried gaming 
with technology and found ourselves interested in applying VR to create our 
own interactive environment and challenge ourselves to create an enjoyable 
game for the user. Our objective is to use Unity to create three different 
scenes in which a character controlled by the user will have to get to the 
end of the map avoiding different obstacles along the way by jumping and 
running away from the objects created to stop the character. The game 
will provide an enjoyable environment for the user to get 
distracted from the stress of the real world and find interactive 
challenges that will be fun to overcome while using the Quest 2 headset.

\section{Related Wrok}
Previous researches like (Monteiro et al, 2018) have shown that when using VR headset in a virtual environment game based on a first-person perspective can lead to simulator sickness and discomfort from the user. Whereas in a third person perspective it is less likely that simulator sickness occurs. However in a third person display, the immersiveness of the game is lost.

Our group was put in the dilemma of doing a third person perspective or a first person perspective. We wanted to make an enjoyable game for all users and not worry about motion sickness, but the virtual reality aspect and immersiveness that we were looking for for the project was not going to be there. Since our project is still in development we are still in discussion on what would be the best solution for this problem.

We implemented some environment interactions and objects and Unity techniques to build and run our scenes on Android platform from different online tutorials (Tevfik, 2020)


\section{Methods}
This project started as a basic obstacle course game from an Unity Asset Store package called “Obstacle Course Pack” (AisuKase Studio, 2018). This package contained different elements and a movable player that could jump and move with keyboard controls.

To implement this package and the obstacle concept of the game into Virtual Reality, we had to create our own 3D world and make the Quest 2 headset work with Unity, which caused some problems since our team members had Apple devices and Unity needed to be configured manually to work with macOS systems. After overcoming our own obstacles we proceed to create the different level scenarios, specifically Desert, Forest and City and using different assets from various resources online, we could create an environment that simulated the desired world setting.

To make the game more challenging and make the objective of the game not solely to get to the end, we implemented a timer that was attached to the headset view.  With this timer the user will have to be focused on going through all the obstacles and get to the end of the level as fast as possible before the time ends and the screen displays a game over scene or try again.

The game will be playable with a Quest 2 VR headset and control joystick will be used to move and turn the character.  Control main triggers will be used to make the character jump. We had to ensure that the user played in a safe environment since the user will be immersed in a virtual world and will not have visual contact with the real world. To do that we limited the movement from our controls to interact as little as possible.  

On the Desert level, interaction with the environment included grabbing rocks with the secondary triggers. The rocks were interactable to be used to throw them at animated chickens (chickens are subject to change due to animal rights) and when the rock made contact with the chicken the user would get more time added to finish the level. [Alberto Chan Liu]

There are some interactions used in desert city scene. Users are able to control their moving direction by VR headset. Players can control their jump by the main trigger of the touch controller. In addition, we have a countdown timer. When the player collides with obstacles, players will be pushed back or bounced into the sky, and it will waste players’ time.When players run out of time, the game will show a game  over menu, and players can choose “try again” or “quit game”. When players reach the finish line, there is an event trigger which will take players to the congratulations menu,and they can choose the next level scene. [Zhipeng Yang]

Throughout the design phase of our VR game, many interaction methods were employed to create a fuller player experience. For interactions, the end goal of our project is to have players complete obstacle challenges in virtual reality through some minimal physical movements. For reference frames, the forest level is intended to use the torso reference frame which moves with both physical and virtual rotation. In terms of user locomotion, we plan to have them walk in place while also having control to character movement through the controller. We aim to minimize user moving range but add as many in-place movements as possible for safe considerations. We use controllers over bare hands because of their features of reliability and capability of adding haptics. [Irene Zhang]

\section{User Evaluation and Results}
The obstacle game starts with the main menu which includes buttons of the three main levels and three eagles flying around with sound effects and game music that made the user of the game feel comfortable and prepared them to start the game. Once it chooses the level desired to play, the user is immediately put into the start of the level chosen to play and timer starts running, this makes the user of the game  change its focus immediately to look at the world created by us and start looking for a way to reach the end point of the level.

We notice that users that are not familiar with the usage of VR systems will tend to feel motion sickness when the game is played for a long time so we decided to make the timer be less than 2 minutes and be able to be personalized in Unity.

As an added interaction with the obstacles we made the player bounce against some of the movable obstacles and in some levels play a sound that seemed enjoyable by the users. Although not all the interactions with objects work efficiently and as desired, like the feeling of going through objects and some objects pushing the user too far, the game still was enjoyable.

At the end menus of the game we added a scene for winning the game and losing. In both of these scenes we included an animated chicken so that the player could also visually enjoy the end of the game even if the outcome was not as desired.

\section{Discussions and Conclusions}
Using Unity and all its features to create our virtual reality worlds was really challenging and beneficial to us since it  put our programming skills and creativity to work. Unity is a really powerful tool for developers like us to be creative and use this program to make more than just games, but real intricate applications compatible with Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality and much more.

The decision to change the main character from a third person player to a first person player was the best idea for our project to be more immersive and interactable for the user. It made the controls and movement more natural for a person and the interactions more real.

Our obstacle game resulted in a really enjoyable VR game that challenged the user to interact with different objects and obstacles included on the levels created by us. The user  by going through our personalized immersive worlds and drawing players into a reality made by us.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item If you receive compilation errors along the lines of ``\texttt{Package ifpdf Error: Name clash, \textbackslash ifpdf is already defined}'' then please add a new line ``\texttt{\textbackslash let\textbackslash ifpdf\textbackslash relax}'' right after the ``\texttt{\textbackslash documentclass[journal]\{vgtc\}}'' call. Note that your error is due to packages you use that define ``\texttt{\textbackslash ifpdf}'' which is obsolete (the result is that \texttt{\textbackslash ifpdf} is defined twice); these packages should be changed to use ifpdf package instead.
% \item The style uses the hyperref package, thus turns references into internal links. We thus recommend to make use of the ``\texttt{\textbackslash autoref\{reference\}}'' call (instead of ``\texttt{Figure\~{}\textbackslash ref\{reference\}}'' or similar) since ``\texttt{\textbackslash autoref\{reference\}}'' turns the entire reference into an internal link, not just the number. Examples: \autoref{fig:sample} and \autoref{tab:vis_papers}.
% \item The style automatically looks for image files with the correct extension (eps for regular \LaTeX; pdf, png, and jpg for pdf\LaTeX), in a set of given subfolders (figures/, pictures/, images/). It is thus sufficient to use ``\texttt{\textbackslash includegraphics\{CypressView\}}'' (instead of ``\texttt{\textbackslash includegraphics\{pictures/CypressView.jpg\}}'').
% \item For adding hyperlinks and DOIs to the list of references, you can use ``\texttt{\textbackslash bibliographystyle\{abbrv-doi-hyperref-narrow\}}'' (instead of ``\texttt{\textbackslash bibliographystyle\{abbrv\}}''). It uses the doi and url fields in a bib\TeX\ entry and turns the entire reference into a link, giving priority to the doi. The doi can be entered with or without the ``\texttt{http://dx.doi.org/}'' url part. See the examples in the bib\TeX\ file and the bibliography at the end of this template.\\[1em]
% \textbf{Note 1:} occasionally (for some \LaTeX\ distributions) this hyper-linked bib\TeX\ style may lead to \textbf{compilation errors} (``\texttt{pdfendlink ended up in different nesting level ...}'') if a reference entry is broken across two pages (due to a bug in hyperref). In this case make sure you have the latest version of the hyperref package (i.\,e., update your \LaTeX\ installation/packages) or, alternatively, revert back to ``\texttt{\textbackslash bibliographystyle\{abbrv-doi-narrow\}}'' (at the expense of removing hyperlinks from the bibliography) and try ``\texttt{\textbackslash bibliographystyle\{abbrv-doi-hyperref-narrow\}}'' again after some more editing.\\[1em]
% \textbf{Note 2:} the ``\texttt{-narrow}'' versions of the bibliography style use the font ``PTSansNarrow-TLF'' for typesetting the DOIs in a compact way. This font needs to be available on your \LaTeX\ system. It is part of the \href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/paratype}{``paratype'' package}, and many distributions (such as MikTeX) have it automatically installed. If you do not have this package yet and want to use a ``\texttt{-narrow}'' bibliography style then use your \LaTeX\ system's package installer to add it. If this is not possible you can also revert to the respective bibliography styles without the ``\texttt{-narrow}'' in the file name.\\[1em]
% DVI-based processes to compile the template apparently cannot handle the different font so, by default, the template file uses the \texttt{abbrv-doi} bibliography style but the compiled PDF shows you the effect of the \texttt{abbrv-doi-hyperref-narrow} style.
% \end{itemize}

% \section{Bibliography Instructions}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Sort all bibliographic entries alphabetically but the last name of the first author. This \LaTeX/bib\TeX\ template takes care of this sorting automatically.
% \item Merge multiple references into one; e.\,g., use \cite{Max:1995:OMF,Kitware:2003} (not \cite{Kitware:2003}\cite{Max:1995:OMF}). Within each set of multiple references, the references should be sorted in ascending order. This \LaTeX/bib\TeX\ template takes care of both the merging and the sorting automatically.
% \item Verify all data obtained from digital libraries, even ACM's DL and IEEE Xplore  etc.\ are sometimes wrong or incomplete.
% \item Do not trust bibliographic data from other services such as Mendeley.com, Google Scholar, or similar; these are even more likely to be incorrect or incomplete.
% \item Articles in journal---items to include:
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item author names
% 	\item title
% 	\item journal name
% 	\item year
% 	\item volume
% 	\item number
% 	\item month of publication as variable name (i.\,e., \{jan\} for January, etc.; month ranges using \{jan \#\{/\}\# feb\} or \{jan \#\{-{}-\}\# feb\})
%   \end{itemize}
% \item use journal names in proper style: correct: ``IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'', incorrect: ``Visualization and Computer Graphics, IEEE Transactions on''
% \item Papers in proceedings---items to include:
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item author names
% 	\item title
% 	\item abbreviated proceedings name: e.\,g., ``Proc.\textbackslash{} CONF\_ACRONYNM'' without the year; example: ``Proc.\textbackslash{} CHI'', ``Proc.\textbackslash{} 3DUI'', ``Proc.\textbackslash{} Eurographics'', ``Proc.\textbackslash{} EuroVis''
% 	\item year
% 	\item publisher
% 	\item town with country of publisher (the town can be abbreviated for well-known towns such as New York or Berlin)
%   \end{itemize}
% \item article/paper title convention: refrain from using curly brackets, except for acronyms/proper names/words following dashes/question marks etc.; example:
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item paper ``Marching Cubes: A High Resolution 3D Surface Construction Algorithm''
% 	\item should be entered as ``\{M\}arching \{C\}ubes: A High Resolution \{3D\} Surface Construction Algorithm'' or  ``\{M\}arching \{C\}ubes: A high resolution \{3D\} surface construction algorithm''
% 	\item will be typeset as ``Marching Cubes: A high resolution 3D surface construction algorithm''
% \end{itemize}
% \item for all entries
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item DOI can be entered in the DOI field as plain DOI number or as DOI url; alternative: a url in the URL field
% 	\item provide full page ranges AA-{}-BB
% \end{itemize}
% \item when citing references, do not use the reference as a sentence object; e.\,g., wrong: ``In \cite{Lorensen:1987:MCA} the authors describe \dots'', correct: ``Lorensen and Cline \cite{Lorensen:1987:MCA} describe \dots''
% \end{itemize}
